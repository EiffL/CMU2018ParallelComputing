# Exercise 1: What is this trying to compute ? and why is it not working ?

To run this script from within an interactive job on Cori:
```
$ srun -n 8 -c 16 shifter -- python code.py
```

 - If `N` is the number of processes, what is this script trying to compute ?  
  Hint: it's a simple function of `N`

 - Why isn't it working ?

 - Can you fix it ?
